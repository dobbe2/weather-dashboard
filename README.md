## Features

* Geolocation lookup using Geocode API
* Top track lookup by country
* JS library for ISO 3166 country codes

## How to use
* Visit https://kindrakinney.github.io/Local-Tunes/

## Known Bugs
* ~~"LOAD MORE" appends results from USA only, not the user specified country.~~
* Songs don't load in perfect order by popularity (When you load more results, they usually scramble, making it harder for someone to keep their place on where they left off before they hit load more)
* If one of the top artists isn't found on the last.fm list, it will recieve an error 6 message and not render anything to page.

## Future Development
* Allow users to save their favorite songs / playlists of results, and make a Spotify playlist.
* Integrate with mutltiple song API's to get more local results, hopefully by state.
* Expand relevant information provided to user for each song / artist card.
