using the openweathermap API

search for city bar.
when input typed and searched, 3 things will need to happen
    1. Searched city saves in list below searchbar
    2. City data shows in seperate div with City Name, date, icon, temp, humidity, wind speed, and UV indes
    3. Show a 5 day forecast, one per card, and have date, icon, temp, and humidity on each card.
each previous seatched city is saved in local storage as well as saved below the search bar
When page is reloaded, show last searched city on page load

BONUS* use Geolocation API to add users current location to initial landing page

To get UV Index, I will need to get the current searched citys lat and long coordinates and covert them to a seperate API call from weatherAPI
